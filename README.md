Our app is built with the latest and most advanced technologies to provide a comprehensive solution for home selling. Here are some of the technologies that we have used to make our app as user-friendly and efficient as possible:
React Native: Our app is built with React Native, a cross-platform development framework that allows us to build the app for both IOS and Android devices. This means that our app can be used by a wide range of users, regardless of their device type.
Firebase: We use Firebase, a real-time database service, to store and retrieve data in real-time. This ensures that our users always have access to the most up-to-date information and that their data is always secure and accessible.
Stripe Integration: We have integrated Stripe, a leading payment processing platform, into our app. This allows for easy and secure payment processing, ensuring that our users can complete the home-selling process with ease.
Revenue Cat Library: We have integrated the Revenue Cat library which allows us to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. This means that users can purchase additional features or subscribe to premium plans easily and securely.
Live Document Scanning: Our app features live document scanning, allowing users to quickly and easily scan any necessary documents, such as ids. This eliminates the need for manual input and ensures accuracy.
Digital Signature: Our app also includes digital signature functionality, allowing for secure and legally binding signatures. This eliminates the need for physical signatures and ensures that all parties involved in the home-selling process are protected.
Advanced Security Measures: We have implemented advanced security measures such as encryption and multi-factor authentication to ensure the protection of sensitive information and transactions within the app.
